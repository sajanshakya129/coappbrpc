This library is developed to create a R\+PC that utilises features of Co\+AP protocol which uses U\+DP for transport. Protobuf is used as Interface Definition language(\+I\+D\+L). The goal is to use this R\+PC library over Constrained IoT devices.

\subsection*{Getting Started}

The following steps are written with the consideration that the system for development is fresh newly installed Linux Based System.

\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}

Please install following applications to build and install coappbrpc. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential dh-autoreconf python python-pip
\end{DoxyCode}
 \paragraph*{Protocol buffer library Installation}

Follow the following link and https\+://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md \char`\"{}install protobuf\char`\"{} Or follow the following steps 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
\end{DoxyCode}


\#\#\#\# Lib\+Co\+AP version 2 Library Installation 
\begin{DoxyCode}
git clone https://github.com/obgm/libcoap.git
cd libcoap
\end{DoxyCode}
 O\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N\+AL\+:You might need to install pkg-\/config in your system if \textquotesingle{}pkg-\/config\textquotesingle{} is not found. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
\end{DoxyCode}
 Then configure libcoap and install libcoap 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-doxygen --disable-manpages
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
\end{DoxyCode}


\#\# Installation of Co\+A\+P\+Pbrpc library 
\begin{DoxyCode}
git clone --single-branch -b newbranch https://github.com/sajanshakya129/coappbrpc
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Running Example}

Go to example/src folder and generate stub files required using following commands. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd [Project Folder]/example/
coappbrpc.sh rpc\_ping.proto
\end{DoxyCode}
 Client\+Stub.\+sh Client\+Stub.\+h are autogenerated.

\#\#\# Compiling and Running using cmake 
\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
make
\end{DoxyCode}
 \paragraph*{Running client}

In example folder, bin folder is created with executable files i.\+e. client and server 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./bin/client
\end{DoxyCode}
 \#\#\#\# Running Server 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./bin/server
\end{DoxyCode}
 OR

\#\#\# Compiling and Running Client from terminal manually 
\begin{DoxyCode}
g++ -o client rpc\_ping.pb.cc ClientStub.cc client.cpp -lcoappbrpc -lcoap-2 -lprotobuf -lpthread
./client
\end{DoxyCode}
 \#\#\# Compiling and Running Server from terminal manually 
\begin{DoxyCode}
g++ -o server rpc\_ping.pb.cc server.cpp -lcoappbrpc -lcoap-2 -lprotobuf -lpthread
./server
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Documentation}

Detailed explanation of functions and classes can be found in folder documentation. You can run web based documentation by running documentation/html/index.\+html file. You can also check Wi\+Ki for supportive documentations

\subsection*{Uninstall library}

To uninstall library and files related from your system. you need to execute following command.
